    Controls:
    <ul>
      <li>Orbit Control: move camera around, zoom in/out</li>
      <li>GUI Control Widget: Several controls for the camera and four different lights</li>
    </ul>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Castle is made with primary shapes - cube, cone, cylinder;
        has animated icosahedron gems within the inner boundary; and is placed inside a skybox</li>
      <li>Number of shapes used in the castle: 20 (five towers) + (8 + 19 x 4) (two boundary walls) + 7 gems inside</li>
      <li>The center of the castle is slightly shifted away from origin to [-20, -20, -20]. All coordinates in the controls are with respect to the actual origin</li>
      <li>Has 3 light sources: ambient, directional, and spotlight with some controls</li>
      <li>Spotlight is focused on one of the gems</li>
      <li>To see the effect of any light (e.g. spotlight) properly. minimize the intensity of other lights</li>
      <li>Castle walls have stone texture (from <a href="https://cc0-textures.com/t/cc0t-bricks-008">https://cc0-textures.com/t/cc0t-bricks-008</a></li>
      <li>Custom textured 3D model(s) (obj) included: lion head (from <a href="https://polyhaven.com/a/lion_head">https://polyhaven.com/a/lion_head</a> by Tina)</li>
      <li>Extra 1: Fog - can be turned on/off</li>
      <li>Extra 2: Shadows of the gems from the directional light. Changing the light's position (i.e. direction) changes the location and size of the shadows</li>
      <li>Extra 3: Can pick a gem and change its color by clicking on it; clicking on it again restores its color</li>
    </ul>
