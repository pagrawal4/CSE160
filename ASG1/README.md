# Assignment 1: Painting

## Description
In this assignment, I created a web application using WebGL to draw simple geometric shapes made out of squares, triangles, and circles. It is a simple paint program. In this assignment, I also drew a colorful picture of an eagle with just triangles using the data structures of this assignment. Moreover, I created a kaleidoscope type drawing option where the picture drawn by the user is reflected along a set of lines and drawn with new colors.

## Known Bugs
None

## Credits
The code for the examples provided in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of the textbook <i> WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL</i> (https://sites.google.com/site/webglbook) by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea was used as a starting point for doing this assignment. The asssignment YouTube videos were very helpful in doing this assignment.
