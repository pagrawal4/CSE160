# Assignment 0: Vector Library

## Description
In this assignment, the library <i>cuon-matrix.js</i> provided in the textbook has been extended for the basic vector opertions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by a scalar, dot product, cross product, magnitude of a vector, and the normalized form of a vector. The assignment also provides a graphical user interface to show two vectors and some basic vector operations along with the angle between two vectors and the area of the triangle formed by two vectors.

## Known Bugs
None

## Credits
The code for the <i>DrawRectangle</i> example provided in the textbook <i> WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL</i> (https://sites.google.com/site/webglbook) by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea were used as a starting point for doing this assignment. The asssignment YouTube videos as well as answers from the professor and TAs were very helpful in doing this assignment.
